# {Skill Title}

This skill provides instructions for {what it does}. Follow these patterns exactly when generating code.

## Core rules

1. {Most important rule — the one that prevents the worst mistakes}
2. {Second most important rule}
3. {Third rule}
4. {Fourth rule — keep to 3-5 max}

When unsure about a pattern, reference the detailed guides:

- {Topic 2}: [references/{topic-2}.md](references/{topic-2}.md)

## Quick setup

```bash
{minimal setup commands — 3-5 lines max}
